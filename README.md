# Pyxine Snap

## Getting Started

This repository uses [this template](https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo/generate) for local development environment.
It includes the snap and a development site that can be used to install and test it locally.

To interact with the Snap in development mode, you will need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/),
a canary distribution for developers that provides access to upcoming features.

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```
